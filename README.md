# H5P Integration Kit

A comprehensive collection of examples for integrating H5P interactive content into custom applications via self-hosted deployment.

## What is H5P?

[H5P](https://h5p.org) is an open-source framework for creating interactive content: quizzes, presentations, videos, games, and more. The easiest way to use H5P is through [h5p.com](https://h5p.com) (managed hosting), WordPress, Moodle, or other supported platforms.

**This project is for developers who need to self-host H5P** and integrate it with custom applications using simple HTTP APIs.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the H5P Server

**Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)**

```bash
docker compose up -d h5p-server
# Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

**Option B: Using Node.js directly**

```bash
cd h5p-server
npm install
npm start
# Server running at http://localhost:3000
```

> **Important:** The H5P server requires **core library files** (JavaScript, CSS) to function. These are included in `h5p-server/h5p/core/` and `h5p-server/h5p/editor/`. When using Docker, the local `h5p-server/h5p/` directory is mounted into the container. If you see 404 errors for `/h5p/core/js/*.js` files, ensure the volume mount is working correctly.

### 2. Pick an Example

| Example | Language | Best For |
|---------|----------|----------|
| [python-flask](examples/python-flask/) | Python | Simple integration, beginners |
| [python-fastapi](examples/python-fastapi/) | Python | Modern async applications |
| [php](examples/php/) | PHP | WordPress-like environments |
| [dotnet](examples/dotnet/) | C# | Enterprise .NET applications |
| [django](examples/django/) | Python | Full-featured Django apps |
| [lti-provider](examples/lti-provider/) | Python | LMS integration (Moodle, Canvas) |

### 3. Run the Example

```bash
# Flask example
cd examples/python-flask
pip install flask
python app.py

# Open http://localhost:5000
```

## Integration Pattern

All examples follow the same simple pattern:

### Content Creation

```
1. Your app opens popup/iframe to: H5P_SERVER/new?returnUrl=YOUR_CALLBACK
2. User creates content in H5P editor
3. H5P server saves and redirects to: YOUR_CALLBACK?contentId=123
4. Your app stores the contentId in your database
```

### Content Playback

```
1. Your app embeds iframe: H5P_SERVER/play/{contentId}?userId={userId}&webhookUrl={yourWebhook}
2. User interacts with H5P content
3. H5P server sends xAPI score to your webhook (if provided) + postMessage to parent
4. Your app stores the grade
```

> **Note**: The `webhookUrl` parameter is optional. If not provided, xAPI events are only sent via `postMessage` to the parent window (useful for iframe embedding).

### Webhook Payload

```json
{
  "contentId": "abc123",
  "userId": "demo-user",
  "statement": {
    "verb": { "id": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/completed" },
    "result": {
      "score": { "raw": 8, "max": 10 },
      "completion": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Examples Overview

### Simple Examples (~150-300 lines each)

| Example | Description | Run Command |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Flask** | Minimal Python web app | `python app.py` |
| **FastAPI** | Async Python with Pydantic | `uvicorn app:app` |
| **PHP** | No-framework PHP | `php -S localhost:5000` |
| **.NET** | ASP.NET Core minimal API | `dotnet run` |

Each simple example demonstrates:
- Content listing, creation, editing
- H5P player embedding
- Score webhook handling
- SQLite storage

### Full Django Example

The [Django example](examples/django/) includes:
- Reusable `django_h5p` plugin
- Sample LMS with courses and activities
- Grade tracking per user
- Template tags for easy embedding

### LTI 1.3 Tool Provider

The [LTI provider](examples/lti-provider/) allows external LMS platforms to:
- Launch H5P content via LTI 1.3
- Return grades to LMS gradebook
- Works with Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, etc.

## H5P Server

### What It Adds

The `@lumieducation/h5p-server` npm package provides H5P's core functionality, and `@lumieducation/h5p-express` provides AJAX endpoints for the H5P client-side JavaScript. However, as [the docs note](https://docs.lumi.education/usage/ajax-endpoints):

> **The Express adapter does not include pages to create, edit, view, list or delete content!**

Our h5p-server wraps these libraries into a **ready-to-use service** with user-facing routes:

| Base Library Provides | Our Server Adds |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| `/ajax` - AJAX calls for H5P client JS | `/new` - Editor page for new content |
| `/content` - Serve content files | `/edit/:id` - Editor page for existing content |
| `/libraries` - Serve library files | `/play/:id` - Player page with xAPI tracking |
| `/temp-files` - Temporary uploads | `/api/content` - List/delete content REST API |
| `/params` - Content parameters | `returnUrl` - Callback after save with contentId |
| `/download` - H5P package export | `webhookUrl` - POST xAPI scores to your app |
| | `postMessage` - xAPI events to parent window |
| | Cross-origin iframe fixes |
| | Docker image with health checks |

The base library is the **engine**. Our server adds the **user-facing routes and integration glue**.

### API Endpoints

The Node.js H5P server exposes these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/new` | GET | H5P editor for new content |
| `/edit/{id}` | GET | H5P editor for existing content |
| `/play/{id}` | GET | H5P player |
| `/api/content` | GET | List all content |
| `/api/content/{id}` | GET | Get content metadata |
| `/api/content/{id}` | DELETE | Delete content |
| `/health` | GET | Health check |

Query parameters:
- `returnUrl` - Where to redirect after save (for /new, /edit)
- `userId` - User identifier for tracking (for /play)

The H5P client-side JavaScript additionally calls these endpoints on its own (their URLs are part of the `H5PIntegration` object of the player page):

| Endpoint                                                            | Method | Description                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `/contentUserData/{contentId}/{dataType}/{subContentId}?userId=...` | GET    | Load the saved state of a learner                |
| `/contentUserData/{contentId}/{dataType}/{subContentId}?userId=...` | POST   | Save the state of a learner                      |
| `/finishedData?userId=...`                                          | POST   | Store score and duration when a learner finishes |

### Learner state persistence

Content types that support resuming (Course Presentation, Interactive Video, Question Set, Multiple Choice, …) post the current state of the learner to `/contentUserData` every
`contentUserStateSaveInterval` milliseconds (5000 by default, configured in
`h5p-server/h5p/config.json`). The server stores it with the
`FileContentUserDataStorage` of `@lumieducation/h5p-server` as plain JSON files:

```
${H5P_DATA_PATH}/userdata/          # /data/h5p/userdata in the container
├── <contentId>-userdata.json        # one entry per user, dataType and subContentId
└── <contentId>-finished.json        # score, timestamps and duration per user
```

`H5P_DATA_PATH` is the mounted volume, so the states live **outside** the container image and survive `docker compose down`, an image rebuild and a container update. They are only lost if the volume itself is deleted (`docker compose down -v` for a named volume, or deleting `h5p-server/h5p/userdata/` for the bind mount).

The learner is identified by the `userId` query parameter that the server writes into the callback URLs of the player page; requests without it fall back to the user
`anonymous`. So always open the player as `/play/{id}?userId=<your user id>` - otherwise all learners share a single state per content object.

When a content object is edited, states saved with `invalidate: true` are discarded, which is the intended H5P behaviour: the old state no longer matches the changed content. Deleting a content object removes its states and finished data as well.

`h5p-server/test/state-persistence-test.sh` verifies all of this end to end - it saves states, removes container and image, rebuilds the stack and checks that the states are still served to the player afterwards.

## When to Self-Host

For most users, [h5p.com](https://h5p.com) or platform plugins (WordPress, Moodle) are the best choice—they're maintained, supported, and easy to set up.

Self-hosting makes sense when you need:
- **Custom tech stack integration** — embed H5P in Flask, Django, .NET, or any framework
- **Full infrastructure control** — run on your own servers, air-gapped environments, or specific cloud providers
- **Deep customization** — modify the server, add custom xAPI handling, or integrate with existing auth systems
- **Docker/container deployments** — include H5P as a service in your stack

## Requirements

- **H5P Server**: Node.js 18+ (uses @lumieducation/h5p-server)
- **Examples**: See individual README files

## Docker Support

```bash
# Start H5P server with Docker
docker compose up -d h5p-server

# Check it's running
curl http://localhost:3000/health
# Should return: {"status":"ok","service":"h5p-server"}

# For external access (e.g., LTI), set the public URL:
H5P_BASE_URL=https://your-public-url.com docker compose up -d h5p-server
```

For a permanent deployment put the URL into a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`
instead - `cp .env.example .env` and edit it. Docker Compose reads that file automatically; without it the compose file falls back to `http://localhost:3000`.

**Test and production systems:**

`docker-compose.prod.yml` is the deployment variant. It pins `image`, `container_name`
and `hostname`, runs as `1001:1001` (the `h5p` user of the image) and requires
`H5P_BASE_URL` from `.env` - it aborts instead of falling back to localhost.

```bash
cp .env.example .env                    # set H5P_BASE_URL
chown -R 1001:1001 h5p-server/h5p       # the mount has to belong to the container user
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f h5p-bootstrap
```

To avoid passing `-f` on every command, uncomment `COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.prod.yml`
in the `.env` of that host. Docker Compose then uses the deployment file for every
`docker compose` call in this directory - `up`, `down`, `logs`, `config` alike - so the commands above shorten to `docker compose up -d --build`. Keep the line commented out on development machines.

The `h5p-bootstrap` job is part of it and **must** run on a deployment as well: a fresh data directory has an empty library store and the H5P server never fetches missing libraries by itself, so the first content would fail with `install-missing-libraries`. The job is idempotent - already installed content types are skipped - and it exits non-zero if a download failed, so check its log after every deployment.

Both compose files use the same project name and therefore replace each other; do not run them side by side on one host.

**Volume Configuration:**

The `docker-compose.yml` mounts the local `h5p-server/h5p/` directory by default. This includes:
- `core/` - H5P core JavaScript and CSS files
- `editor/` - H5P editor files
- `libraries/` - Downloaded H5P content type libraries
- `content/` - Your saved H5P content
- `userdata/` - Saved learner states and finished data (see [Learner state persistence](#learner-state-persistence))
- `temp/` - Temporary uploads from the editor

For production, you may want to use a named Docker volume instead (see comments in `docker-compose.yml`).

**Production Setup with Named Volume:**

When using a separate data directory or named Docker volume (recommended for production), you must initialize it with the core H5P files before starting the container:

```bash
# Create data directory and copy required files
mkdir -p /var/lib/h5p-data
cp -r h5p-server/h5p/core /var/lib/h5p-data/
cp -r h5p-server/h5p/editor /var/lib/h5p-data/
chown -R 1001:1001 /var/lib/h5p-data  # Match container user

# Run with volume mount
docker run -d --name h5p-server \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /var/lib/h5p-data:/data/h5p \
  -e H5P_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com \
  h5p-server:latest
```

Without the `core/` and `editor/` directories in your data volume, you'll get 404 errors for `/h5p/core/js/*.js` and `/h5p/editor/` files, and the H5P editor/player won't load.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you get `EACCES: permission denied` errors when switching between Docker and local Node.js:
```bash
# Fix ownership to match your local user
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER h5p-server/h5p/
```

The docker-compose.yml uses `user: "${UID}:${GID}"` to run as your host user, avoiding permission conflicts with mounted volumes.

## Licensing

This project uses a dual-license structure:

| Component | License | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| **H5P Server** (`h5p-server/`) | GPL-3.0 | Uses [@lumieducation/h5p-server](https://github.com/Lumieducation/H5P-Nodejs-library) which is GPL-licensed |
| **Examples** (`examples/`) | MIT | Communicate via HTTP API only, no GPL code incorporated |

The HTTP API boundary between components means you can:
- Run the H5P server as a Docker container (GPL applies to server code)
- Use the examples in proprietary projects (MIT allows this)
